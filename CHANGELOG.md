## Unreleased - yyyy-mm-dd

### Breaking Changes

- Completely refactored the interface to use structs and traits rather than top
  level functions. This should allow for users to implement their own protocols
  over traits in addition to the hard-coded 4 byte packet reading/writing that
  we had before.

### New Features

- We now support writing ports that are opened in nouse_stdio mode.

## v0.1.0 - 2018-10-13

The initial release.

### New Features

- Initial implementation with ability to send and receieve commands.
